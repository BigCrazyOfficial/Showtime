# Showtime
Throw balls, bounce around, and just generally make a mess. A small mod made for ModFest: Toybox.
- Craft the **Showtime Staff**, a new mobility tool that lets you cross gaps, scale walls and push people around.
- Pair the **Staff** with the Mace to cosplay as the Soldier from TF2.
- Cover the map in confetti. There's actually so much confetti everywhere. Oh my god, it's all over the floor, it's all over the walls.
